3.1,Channel Selection Menu,"G7 will need a new menu option called “Push to talk” located at the top of the main menu.Selecting this will bring the user to a new push to talk menu. The menu will have numbers listedfrom 1 to 9. At the top there will be a “None” option. At the bottom of the list will be channel thatsays will say “All-call”.Like all menus on the G7, the arrow buttons will highlight the rows. If a user presses OK while arow is highlighted, they will be transitioned to a new screen that says “Selecting channel. Pleasewait...”. Once G7 hears back from the server that the channel is selected, the screen will confirmthe selection by showing the PTT icon with the channel below it for 2 seconds. Then it will goback to the PTT menu.* Now the highlighted row will have the word “Selected” after the number.For example “1 - Selected”.Once a channel is selected, the user will receive all PTT communications from this channel.The “None” channel is the default. Once a channel is selected, power cycling will not reset orremove the selected channel for a particular G7.*There will be edge cases where the device doesn’t hear back from the server or gets a NAK.Let the UX team know about these and we’ll come up with some user digestible way ofdisplaying negative paths."
3.2,All-call,"“All-call” is the name of a special channel that can be selected by the device user. This channelis accessible in the same way the other numbered channels, from the device PTT menu. Theall-call channel can be thought of as the announcement or broadcast channel. When a devicehas the all-call channel selected, all of its transmissions will be heard by all devices in theorganization, regardless of their channel selection.a) A device can’t select all-call and a numbered channel at the same time. Only onechannel can be selected at a time. This goes for numbered channels as well.b) If for example a device is set to channel 2, they will hear channel 2 conversations as wellas all-call broadcasts. When they transmit, only other devices on channel 2 will hear thetransmission.c) A device can not turn off the ability to listen to the all-call channel.d) There is no restriction on the number of devices that can be on the all-call channel atone time.e) Example: If an organization has tentwo devices and all ten of them are on all-call, thenall of the devices will transmit to the entire group. If Joe switches to channel 2, none ofthe remaining nine will hear Joe’s transmissions. Joe will however here any transmissionfrom the remaining nine still on all-call."
3.3,Channel “None”,"If a user has selected none, they will not hear transmissions from any numbered channel. Theywill hear traffic from the all-call channel only. They will be unable to transmit to any channel."
3.4,Buttons and Beeping,PTT will have a hardware button for initiating an outgoing audio transmission.Pressing and holding the mapped PTT button will start an audio transmission. The user needsto hold down the button while talking. Once the user is done with their transition they will releasethe mapped button.We want to keep these delays to a minimum so that the user feels the transition betweenpressing and starting to talk is fast. (see functional requirements)The beep sounds will bookend transmissions start and stop (tri-pulse). Receptions will also bebookended with a different sound (mono-pulse). The transmission sound needs to be uniquebecause users will want to know if they are accidentally transmitting. Reception sounds areunique so that users don’t need to say 10-4. This beeping should be parameterized on the FW.Some users will want to disable one or the other beeping sounds.
3.5,Transmission Display,While pressing the PTT button the LCD will display the PTT icon with the channel informationbelow it. For example “Channel 7”. When all-call is selected it will say “All-call” (I haven’tupdated the graphic below with the dash). When “None” is selected it will say “No channelselected”.
3.6,Transmission Timeout,"The maximum time for a PTT transmission will be 30 seconds. After that, the device will beepand automatically end the transmission. The user will need to release then repress the mappedbutton to start another transmission."
3.7,Priority,"Some sounds will be muted during an audio transmission and some will not. The PTTfunctionality will use the same rules as a voice call. For example, (if I recall correctly) a high/OLgas alert will trump a voice call where as a warning alarm will not.Incoming PTT transmissions will be played at the same time as alarm sounds. The incomingtransmission will likely be unintelligible because of the overlapped alarm, but the user will knowthat they missed a transmission. All gas readings and sensors still need to be active during allPTT transactions.After some discussion it was decided that PTT will be disabled if the device is making noisesdue to being in alarm/alert. Once the device stops making noises PTT will be enabled. Analarm/alert does not have to be resolved just the noise from it has to be muted in order for PTTto work.Voice calls trump and mute all PTT transactions.When two transmissions arrive at the device in unison, ideally they will be played at the sametime. Both incoming transmission will likely be unintelligible but the user will know that two ormore people on the channel where talking at the same time.This needs to change so that the first person to grab the channel gets to transmit on it. Theserver decides who has the channel by the detecting data from a device. The server will alsohave to have some mechanism such as a timeout to release the channel (firmware will includelast message in transmission as well)When a user is recording an outgoing transmission, incoming transmissions should be muted.That’s how radios work.Commented [1]: how does this interact with an all-calltransmission? does an all-call interrupt all activetransmissions on numbered channels? or if numberedchannels have priority, does the transmission to the all-call channel fail if any numbered channel is active?Commented [2]: From discussion with Phil an All Callis not a high priority channel. It will obey the same rulesas any channel. Some devices might not receive the allcall if they have pending rx audio when the All Call istriggeredCommented [3]: Added linkWith our current design, if you are on a channel that has currently been seized by a device youwill not be able to transmit until the other device finishes. An error should be raised to user toindicate you can't transmit. You will hear the message being transmitted on seized channelHigh level server to device sequence diagrams are available here:<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B-xlwCweOpbob0dpMXNVTmU0VDA?ths=true>"
3.8,Start Up,"On power up we will have a new functional settings icon with the text “Push to talk”. It shouldalso indicate the button mapping, the same way it does for SOS and Silent SOS. It will getcomplicated with multiple buttons mapped, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. Wemight not even need to deal with it because for the initial implementation we’ll be veryprescriptive about which buttons are mapped with PTT."
3.9,Info Bar,"On the normal operation screen we will show which channel the device is set on. This will bedisplayed between the battery icon and the check-in countdown timer. There will be a “ch.”followed by the channel number. For example “ch.5”. The all-call channel will be “ch.AC”.a) All PTT functionality: A device can have all PTT functionality disabled. Nothing will beshown in the menu. They will not hear the all-call transmissions.b) Displaying the PTT menu: A device can hear the all-call channel but they cannot seethe PTT menu or select a channel. They will still have the “Push to talk” feature icon onstart up.c) Ability to select all-call channel: A device can hear the all-call channel, see the PTTmenu, select None and channels 1-9. They can not select all-call.d) Toggle on/off the transmit beeps: Ability to turn off the beeps that bookendtransmission from the device.e) Toggle on/off the receive transmission beeps: Ability to turn off the beeps thatbookend receiving a transmission from the device.f) Button mapping: Parameterize all button mapping. Any device initiated function (PTT,SOS, Silent SOS or Early Check-in) could be mapped to any button (up arrow, downarrow, OK, latch push, latch pull). Exceptions being that PTT doesn’t make sense forlatch pull and no functions can be mapped to the power button. Only one buttonmappable function can be mapped to a button at one time, however the same functioncan be mapped to multiple buttons.g) Channel selection: Ability to configure which devices have access to which channels.Not all devices can have access to all channels.h) Custom channel naming: From the portal, channels can be given short custom names.These names will also show up on the device."
3.10,Volume,"We don’t want users to have to alter the volume from their device it we can help it. We alsodon’t want this to be a configuration setting if we can help it. The goal is to make this similar tovoice calling, we set a volume and it works great. For development maybe this is a menuparameter, I’ll leave that to FW."
3.11,Configuration Parameters,Commented [4]: I suggest we do not make thisconfigurable. these options could make training andtroubleshooting far more difficult
4.1,Configuration Page,"To begin, we won’t have a portal configuration page specific to PTT. As you can see from theabove section “Configuration Parameters”, there are a number of parameters which maysomeday need configuration selections. To start, if a device has a PTT service plan, they geteverything. As follow up phases to the project we will add more configuration settings to theportal to begin, we will choose as many defaults as possible."
4.2,Default Button Mapping,"The firmware is going to parameterize the button mapping so it will fall to the software to tell ithow to map buttons. To start, we will be restrictive about this. When PTT is available on adevice, the PTT transmit button will be latch press.If early check-in is enabled at the same time as PTT, the act of transmitting will be considered acheck-in. The user won’t need to hold down the latch for 3 seconds, the device won’t vibrate,the screen won’t show the check-in successful screen, it won’t make the check-in successfulbeep. The device will however reset the reminder countdown on the device and send an earlycheck-in message to the portal.Commented [5]: so the PTT server cannot becompletely standalone... we need to interact with theportal on each transmission so it can decide whether acheck-in has occurredCommented [6]: +kjohnson@blacklinesafety.comCould you confirm the name of the PTT service plansplease._Assigned to Kirk Johnson_Commented [7]: This needs some thought. Linkingfunctionality to the service plan may be tricky. It mightbe better to have a setting on the config that turns PTTon. Need to discuss with devs.If silent alert on latch push is enabled at the same time as PTT, the silent alert will be overriddenand not function at all. Since it will be possible to have a mix of PTT and non-PTT devices in thesame configuration, it will be difficult to intelligently disable Silent SOS. To begin, we’ll add astatic warning message to the Silent SOS setting that tells the user this won’t work with PTT.When we review configurations with the secondary config project we may choose to dosomething more dynamic, but not for the first implementation.If the device already has early check-in enabled, that will move to the OK button. If the devicealready has silent SOS is set to latch press, that will be moved to the OK button. As theconfiguration page stands today a user can’t have silent SOS on latch press and early check-insconfigured at the same time, so this doesn’t change.At some point we will add text to the configuration page explaining this button mapping, but notuntil will have thoroughly tested PTT and confirmed how it will function in the field."
4.3,Service Plans,"There will be two new device service plans. Voice + PTT (formally known as silver) andBlackline monitored voice + PTT (formally known as gold). Kirk will need to confirm namingconventions. Both of these plans include voice. This needs to be shown and selectable in theportal the same way all of our other service plans are. This service plan will give all of thefunctionality of a voice plan, with the added features of PTT.Since the portal will know what service plan a device has, the portal will need to tell the devicewhether or not to display PTT options. This can be bundled into the config message or sent as aseparate message. Work with Firmware on this."
4.4,Organization Specific,"Commented [8]: How do channels work on theserver? If a device is broadcasting on Channel 2 whatdoes the server do?Commented [9]: +kjohnson@blacklinesafety.comCould you confirm pricing? At least as a starting point._Assigned to Kirk Johnson_For phase 1, PTT channels are organization specific. Meaning that a device in organization Aon channel 1 can not hear or speak with a device in organization B on channel 1.This is phase 1 because there is a risk that too many devices using the same channel will“break” the system. We touch on this risk in the 2017-04-21 meeting notes below. For thisreason it is important that the system “fail gracefully”. Meaning that if the system becomesoverloaded at any point (device, server, cell tower) the entire system does not shut down. PTTmessages can be “lost” but alert messages can not. We need to understand the ramifications ofoverload failures because we don’t yet understand the technical limitations of the systemtherefore run the risk of surpassing them.Once we learn more about the system we can “throttle” the number of devices using a set ofchannels. This would be a Phase 2 activity. The basic idea is that a single organization canhave multiple channel sets. Different devices could be assigned to a different channel set. Eachchannel set would have a cap, limiting the number of devices able to use it."
4.5,Functional Requirements,"When pressing the PTT button the beep sound will start immediately. The initial beep should bepulses 750 ms, so 250 ms per pulse, and this will begin the transmission. If the user brieflyholds down the button for, say <500 ms, Then you will only hear half the tone.Use this beeping time to build your buffer and initiate the PTT.Total time of latency between a user talking and their channel members hearing should be 2seconds. From first word spoken to first word heard including the receiving beeps. Includingbeeps. Use the beeps as buffer, start the PTT initiation immediately.Note: A regular phone call is 500 ms.We expect the same voice quality as the current call functionality.Mono sound is fine."
4.6,Pricing,"(Kirk to confirm) An IS Motorola radio is $700. Goal is PTT is +$30/mo to your service plan ona device. This would be $1,080 for three years. That’s pre-discount. Customers won’t really paythis. If we end up at $10 MSRP we failed. $20 feels like the right answer but we are going tostart a little higher and see how we can achieve that stretch goal.Idea: Enterprise model. Organizational PTT. Pay for minute packages. The more you use it themore you get builded. As you use it more that price goes up. Small companies that use it a lotwill pay the same as large companies that use it rarely. This is a similar concept to what wewant to do for Loner mobile. Maybe if you have +300 units you are eligible for the enterpriseoption."
5.1,Custom channel selection and naming,"The device and server side routing tables will support 0-99 channels. We’ll only start with 0-9.Deciding which channels will be displayed on the device will be decided by the portal deviceconfig.We would like to name the channels using the portal device config. For example channel 4might be called “welding group”.Considering the above feature request, here is an example. A team manager can go into theportal and decide that 10 devices are going to have access to 3 channels. The managerchooses to give the devices access to channel 3, 7 and 8. The manager then gives thechannels short custom names Alpha, Beta, Gamma. When the employees look at their devicesthey won’t see 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. They will see 3-Alpha, 7-Beta, 8-Gamma. If a device selects 7-Beta, their G7 status screen will show Ch.7 at the top."
5.2,Loner Mobile integration,Loner Mobile should be able to use this same PTT system and be able to communicate with G7devices on the same channels.
5.3,Portal direct communication,Monitoring personnel with a headset should be able to use their computer to listen to andcommunicate on PTT channels with G7 and Loner Mobile devices. Essentially the web interfacebecomes it’s own PTT device capable of sending and receiving.
5.4,Voice to text,"The portal should be able to transcribe PTT voice communications into written text. Blacklinewould be able to search this information to better understand how customers are using thesystem. This could be used after an alert to review as notes, but we will want to be very carefulhow much of this we display in the customer facing portal UI until we are confident in theaccuracy of the transcribed text."
5.5,Natural language speech recognition - Amazon Lex,"Instead of PTT, a device user can talk to Lex (or Google Assistent). The device user could say. “Change my configuration to SCBA for 30 minutes”. “Clear my peak readings”. “I’m entering a high danger area” or I’m leaving a high danger area”When the device detects a potential fall it could as “I’ve detected a fall, are you ok?” and theuser could respond “Yes” to stand down the pending alarm.Meeting Notes"

5.7,Questions,". What is the total estimated number of customers using PTT? This is total in the system,not on the same channel set. (channel set or pool, describes devices when channel 1 isthe same for multiple devices. The all-call with reach all devices in the same channelset). From a business perspective we don’t want an upper limit on this. If customerswant millions of them we are happy to support that.. We should aim for a user base of 100,000 before a re-architecture is required.. How many devices can share a channel set at one time?. The portal aims for 5,000 per org. Having that many users on a channel setposes technical issues and usability issues. We are not trying to achieve 5,000.. Even 100 devices on the same channel set is a lot. This should be our upperlimit.. MVP (minimum viable product) will be 25 devices on the same channel set.. How many can be on the all-call channel at one time?. If we have to limit the number of devices set to all-call due to technical limitationswe can have a limit of 5. From a usability point of view we would prefer to notforce this limitation. It will become unusable from a practical perspective, makingit almost self-officiated. If we have to limit it, we’ll come up with a way for theserver to NAK (reject) a device request to use the all-call and display a messageto that effect.. How do we define a channel set? Organization, Group or Other?Commented [10]: We also need to know how thedevice users will use PTT. The upper bound is thatthere is continuous traffic on each channel.Commented [11]: I'm not clear on this. My thinking isthis limit is defined by the above parameters. That is,channels). Transmitting on the All-Channel goes to alldevices in the channel set. Therefore the limit of the all-channel is 100 devices.Is this what you are thinking Phil?Commented [12]: we should call this solutionabandoned right away. By setting the channel set atthe organization level we would restrict a large andprobably geographically diverse organization to only 8channels.I think groups is the way to go in order to enable thesolution to scale. We can limit each user to a singlePTT group.. Channel sets are described above as being determined by the organization. With. Groups was pitched as an idea, and as a lot of appeal. The main problem is thevenn-diagram effect. Devices can be in multiple groups at one time.. We’ll probably need to define a separate way to assign a channel set. This couldbe through a configuration, which would be clean, but perhaps limiting if thecompany wants to have two different configurations on the same channel set.Alternatively, channel sets could be an option within a device configuration. Thatis the most flexible, but introduces another layer of complexity for users.. If we limit the number of users in a channel set, this will need to be handled bythe server. It will need some UI to let customers know when and why this is beinglimited."
5.8,Risks,". Data plan on device sims. There is a risk of the cost being high. We may need a new plan. May need to goback to pooling. To mitigate this, Kevin Meyers has been asked to look into theoptions if/when we need more data.. Risk in latency issues. FW is concerned that our SIM plans might throttle datadepending on the carrier our SIM is using.. Inconsistent latency. Latency will depend on time of day, number of users, location.. We won’t be able to guarantee a maximum latency to customers.. Voice Quality. Very best case, it will be the same as a voice call. But this is not expected andit’s all downhill from there.. Battery drain. Depends how much someone uses PTT. We’re unsure of the impact but itsounds like low risk for the expected use cases.. Server message priority. Currently the server doesn’t prioritize messages. With the increase in servertraffic this may be the point where we don’t just spend more money on a biggerserver, we prioritize important messages like alerts.. Single VPN pipe. We only have one VPN machine at Amazon. This already keeps Ray up at nightbecause it is a single point of failure with no back up.. With the added load on the VPN it would be a good time to pay for the extra pipe.It will lower our risk for all traffic, not just PTT.. In bed with Telnor. This project will make it a little harder to move away from Telenor if we have to.Not impossible though. Once we figure it out with them, we could figure it out withanother carrier.. We’re more tied to Telenor because of the SIMs in the field.. Does this make us a “telecommunication provider”?. If so there are requirements, for example law enforcement might want access toour transmissions.. Scott Jacobson raised this issue and is looking into it."
5.9,Technical Choices,. Mixing two transmissions at the same time.. FW was planning on handling the mixing of multiple transmissions that arrive atthe device simultaneously. A maximum of 3 would be compiled together at once.. Alternatively SW could handle the mixing and send that out to the device ordevices receiving them.. The customer won’t see a difference between these two methods. It will be atechnical choice made by FW and SW.. No mixing is planned anymore.
