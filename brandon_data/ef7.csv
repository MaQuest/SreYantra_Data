SubSec 1.,1.,Introduction;
SubSec 1.1,1.1,General
SubSec 1.1.1,1.1.1,This specification has been developed within UIC Project EIRENE. It specifies thefunctional requirements for a digital radio standard for the European railways and ispart of the Technical Specification for Interoperability.
SubSec 1.2,1.2,Scope
SubSec 1.2.1,1.2.1,"The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines the requirements of a radiosystem satisfying the mobile communications needs of the European railways1. Itencompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the groundbasedmobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff andrailway administrative and managerial personnel.National EIRENE networkOther EIRENEnetwork(s)Voice and data communications, eg:- driver- ERTMS/ETCS- other on train users- passenger informationShunting communicationsTrain communicationsWide area communicationsRailway fixednetworkInternational trainsFigure 1-1: Scope of EIRENE"
SubSec 1.2.2,1.2.2,"The scope of this specification is to provide interoperability for trains and staff crossingnational or other borders between systems, and to provide manufacturing economiesof scale wherever practical."
SubSec 1.2.3,1.2.3,The primary objective of this specification is to ensure interoperability alonginternational lines which are generally high speed and cross suburban areas with ahigh level of traffic.
SubSec 1.2.4,1.2.4,It is also important for this specification to provide an appropriate standard for futurereplacement of national radio systems operating on both important internal routes andlow to medium traffic rural areas. It will be determined on a national basis whetherdifferent classes of service need to be defined for such routes.
SubSec 1.3,1.3,Applicability
SubSec 1.3.1,1.3.1,"The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines a set of requirementswhich a railway radio system should comply with, in order to facilitate internationalinteroperability between national railways and manufacturing economies of scale. Thisspecification therefore defines the functional requirements, to ensure that core railwayfunctionality is provided."
SubSec 1.3.2,1.3.2,"The specification distinguishes between the requirements affecting a railway’s networkinfrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerningmobiles which will be used in any EIRENE-compliant network."
SubSec 1.3.3,1.3.3,"The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories:- Mandatory (indicated by ‘(M)’ at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory thateach railway meets these specifications on lines where interoperability is required.- Optional (indicated by ‘(O)’ at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not beingmandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined inthe SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreedstandard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in developmentand manufacture.- Information (indicated by ‘(I)’ at the end of the paragraph). These are statementsintended to provide explanatory notes."

SubSec 10.1,10.1,Introduction
SubSec 10.1.1,10.1.1,"In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, inparticular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming betweennetworks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other informationstored in the network. (I)"
SubSec 10.1.2,10.1.2,"For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscriptiontypes might be used, for example: (I)- Cab radio;- on-train radio;- controller;- trackside worker;- general staff;- data services;- administration/management."
SubSec 10.2,10.2,Allocation of priorities
SubSec 10.2.1,10.2.1,A number of levels of priority shall be required in order to offer different grades ofservice to different users and calls. Five levels of priority shall be defined: (M)- Railway emergency;- control-command (safety);- public emergency and group calls between drivers in the same area;- railway operation;- railway information.
SubSec 10.2.2,10.2.2,"In order to provide interoperability, priorities shall be allocated consistently across allEIRENE networks, as shown in the following table. (M)"
SubSec 10.2.3,10.2.3,The lowest priority ongoing call shall be pre-empted before that of a higher priority.(M)
SubSec 10.2.4,10.2.4,"In the case where an EIRENE mobile attempts to make a Railway emergency call over apublic network, the ability to pre-empt lower priority calls (particularly publicemergency calls) may be inhibited, unless a special agreement is in place. (I)"
SubSec 10.3,10.3,Call restriction
SubSec 10.3.1,10.3.1,Various types of call restriction may be employed by the railways as an additionalsecurity measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network accessto the radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling driversand drivers calling members of the public). (O)
SubSec 10.3.2,10.3.2,Any implementation of such call restrictions shall not affect internationalinteroperability. (M)
SubSec 10.4,10.4,Group membership

SubSec 11.,11.,Functional numbering and location dependent addressing;
SubSec 11.1,11.1,General
SubSec 11.1.1,11.1.1,There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’rather than a telephone number. Such numbers are generally only associated with auser for a limited period of time. (I)
SubSec 11.1.2,11.1.2,The addressing scheme can be divided into two areas: (I)- functional addressing;- location dependent addressing.
SubSec 11.2,11.2,Functional addressing
SubSec 11.2.1,11.2.1,Principles
SubSec 11.2.1.1,11.2.1.1,An addressing scheme shall be provided which permits users to be identified bynumbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to theterminal equipment that they are using. (M)
SubSec 11.2.1.10,11.2.1.10,"It shall be possible to call EIRENE users by functional numbers from a wide range ofterminals (EIRENE and non-EIRENE). Examples include EIRENE mobiles, controllerterminals, railway fixed network telephones and public telephones. (All such calls willbe subject to any access restrictions – see section 10.3.) (M)"
SubSec 11.2.1.11,11.2.1.11,The functional addressing scheme should permit calls to be routed from a controller toan international train within the control area without reference to any EIRENE systemother than that providing service to the international train. (O)
SubSec 11.2.1.2,11.2.1.2,The primary usage of functional addressing will be for controllers to establishcommunications with train drivers by making use of the train number. The trainnumber will vary between journeys although EIRENE equipment in the cab is unlikelyto change. (I)
SubSec 11.2.1.3,11.2.1.3,"Other uses of functional addressing will include identifying on-train functions andother users performing particular roles such as shunting team leaders, maintenanceteam members, etc. (I)"
SubSec 11.2.1.4,11.2.1.4,It shall be possible to assign up to a minimum of 3 functional numbers to an EIRENEuser at any one time. (M)
SubSec 11.2.1.5,11.2.1.5,Only one EIRENE user shall be assigned to a given functional number at any one time.(M)
SubSec 11.2.1.6,11.2.1.6,Deleted.
SubSec 11.2.1.7,11.2.1.7,"A user shall be able to set up a functional number on one network, and cancel thenumber from another network. (M)"
SubSec 11.2.1.8,11.2.1.8,The functional number shall remain valid as a user roams from one network toanother. (M)
SubSec 11.2.1.9,11.2.1.9,"The functional addressing scheme shall be independent of specific configurations ofmobile and terminal equipment. For example, the functional number of a conductor onboard a particular train shall be the same irrespective of whether the conductoraccesses the network through the Cab radio or has a separate dedicated EIRENEmobile. (M)"
SubSec 11.2.2,11.2.2,Format of functional numbers
SubSec 11.2.2.1,11.2.2.1,"Functional numbers must be unique within the domain of operation. Since the numbermust be independent of networks, each number must be unique across all networks(including implementation of EIRENE facilities on public networks). (M)"
SubSec 11.2.2.2,11.2.2.2,The functional number shall consist of numeric characters only. (M)
SubSec 11.2.2.3,11.2.2.3,"If alphanumeric numbers are applied by a national railway, the railway will beresponsible for the translation to unique numeric functional numbers compatible withthe EIRENE specification. (I)"

SubSec 11.2.3.3,11.2.3.3,"If the user initiating the call has more than one functional identity, the user shall beable to select, prior to call establishment, which functional identity is presented to thereceiving user. (M)"
SubSec 11.2.3.4,11.2.3.4,"In the case of Cab radio, when a train number is assigned as a functional identity, thisshall take priority over other Cab radio functional identities, and shall be the functionalidentity for the Cab radio to be displayed to other users. (M)"
SubSec 11.2.3.5,11.2.3.5,The functional identity shall be presented to the user in a form which can be readilyunderstood (eg ‘driver of train abcd’ rather than ‘abcd01’ or ‘xyz shunting team 3’rather than ‘xyz03’). (M)
