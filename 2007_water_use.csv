SR10 ,"Report the per capita daily water figures for the permitted amount, reported amount and adjusted number for per utility.  The formula for adjusted gross capita is:  WD + IM - EX -TL - SU - EM   Population where: WD = ground water & surface water withdrawals IM = water imported/bought from another supplier EX = Water exported/sold to other suppliers TL = treatment loss (typically R/O or sand filtration SU = Significant uses EM = Environmental mitigation, if required as a District permit condition. Population = Functional population ",

Block group and ""place"" level Census Transportation Planning Package data on total workers in Parts A and B for calculating net service area commuter populations (the planned highway and road construction - to see commuter data and areas of growth). Census group and block data (total and by age), housing units, household, and group quarters population. Zip code tabulation areas (ZCTA) by age. Public Supply Service areas.

JY2 ,"Make the following property appraiser data available so you can improve the ability to project service area populations in inter-Census years in several ways: Provide a more discreet and up-to-date count of housing units in a utility service area. Help determine when a DRI is completed. Match commercial properties by the connection data provided by utilities.  Use lot sizes, where available, to determine its role in household water use compared to other variables in research projects. There may be other data of use as well (wells, pools, etc). ",
